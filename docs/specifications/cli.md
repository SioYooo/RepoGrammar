# CLI Specification

RepoGrammar's CLI is designed around implementation-pattern families, not
generic symbol graph navigation.

## v0.1 command surface

Project lifecycle:

- `init`
- `uninit`
- `index`
- `sync`
- `status`
- `doctor`
- `unlock`

Pattern-family queries:

- `find`
- `families`
- `family`
- `member`
- `explain`
- `check`
- `files`
- `units`

Agent integration:

- `serve`
- `install`
- `uninstall`

Metrics:

- `stats`
- `telemetry`

Maintenance:

- `version`
- `help`

## Pattern-family commands

`repogrammar find` is the main human-facing equivalent of the MCP
`find_analogues` tool. It must return candidate families, target compatibility,
dominant patterns, variation points, exceptions, unknowns, and a minimal
contrastive evidence set. It must not return only top-k similar files.

`repogrammar family` is the CLI equivalent of `show_family`.

`repogrammar explain` is the CLI equivalent of `explain_deviation`.

`repogrammar check` is the CLI equivalent of `check_conformance`.

All query commands must support:

- `--project <path>`
- `--token-budget <n>`
- `--json`
- `--include-variations`
- `--include-exceptions`

## Long-running commands

All long-running commands must support:

- `--progress auto|always|never`
- `--json`
- `--quiet`
- `--verbose`

Long-running commands include repository initialization, indexing, sync, and MCP
serving.

## Installer commands

`install` and `uninstall` must support:

- `--target`
- `--scope global|project`
- `--dry-run`
- `--yes`
- `--print-config`
- `--no-telemetry`
- `--no-permissions`

## Disallowed top-level graph commands

The following CodeGraph-style names must not be added as top-level v0.1
commands:

- `callers`
- `callees`
- `impact`
- `affected`
- `node`
- `explore`

If call-graph functionality is later needed, it must live under a secondary
namespace such as `repogrammar graph callers` and must not be presented as the
primary value proposition.

## Current implementation status

The bootstrap recognizes the command surface and required options. Commands that
would mutate repository state, install agent configuration, run indexing, or
serve MCP return explicit not-implemented errors until those implementations are
designed and tested.
