# Dependency Rules

## Allowed dependencies

- `core` may depend only on Rust standard library and explicitly accepted domain
  dependencies.
- `ports` may depend on `core`.
- `application` may depend on `core` and `ports`.
- `interfaces` may depend on `application`, `core`, and stable transport-neutral
  types.
- `adapters` may depend on `core`, `ports`, and their concrete external
  libraries.
- `bin` may wire all layers together.
- language-native workers under `src/workers/` may use their native compiler or
  language-service ecosystem behind a versioned protocol.

## Forbidden dependencies

- `core` must not depend on `interfaces`, `adapters`, `ports`, Tree-sitter,
  SQLite, MCP SDKs, filesystem, process execution, or network access.
- `ports` must not expose Tree-sitter nodes, SQLite rows, MCP payloads, or other
  concrete third-party transport types.
- `application` must not run SQL, inspect Tree-sitter nodes, or parse MCP
  transport payloads directly.
- `interfaces` must not implement pattern-family mining rules.
- `repo_guard` must not call product runtime code.

## Tree-sitter boundary

Tree-sitter is the intended universal syntax technology, but parser AST nodes stay in
`src/rust/adapters/parsing/` and language-specific adapter modules. Adapters convert
parser output into `core::model` types before returning through `ports::parser`.

Tree-sitter is not a complete semantic analyzer. It can generate syntax
features, changed ranges, code-unit candidates, decorator/call shapes, and
structural fingerprints, but compiler-native semantic facts take precedence over
structural heuristics.

## Semantic worker boundary

Language-native semantic workers belong under `src/workers/` or
`src/rust/adapters/semantic_workers/`. They may use official compiler,
type-checker, or LSP APIs for their language. All compiler-native facts must be
translated into RepoGrammar-owned semantic facts before entering `core`.

When a semantic worker is unavailable, version-incompatible, conflicting with
another analyzer, or unable to decide a dynamic behavior, the result must be
`UNKNOWN` or abstention.

## SQLite boundary

SQLite and migration execution logic belong in `src/rust/adapters/persistence/`.
Storage use cases depend on `ports::family_store` and `ports::source_store`,
not direct SQL calls.

## MCP boundary

MCP tool names, schemas, transport errors, and serialization rules belong in
`src/rust/interfaces/mcp/`. Domain classifications are expressed in core types before
they are serialized for MCP.

## Test code boundary

All test source lives under `src/`, either next to modules with `#[cfg(test)]`,
in `src/rust/integration_tests/`, or in documented test-support modules. Root
`tests/`, `benches/`, `examples/`, and `scripts/` directories are not allowed.

## src-only rule

All source, executable, test, benchmark, migration-tool, fixture-source, worker,
and automation-tool code must live under `src/`, regardless of implementation
language. `repo-guard check` enforces this by detecting common source extensions
outside `src/`.
